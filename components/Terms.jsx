                By executing an Order Form for purchase of a Flagright Service,
                Customer is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Term.

                expressly permitted by Section 6.4 (Termination for Cause) and

                on the applicable Order Form, the Term starts when Customer
                first obtains access to the Flagright Service. Each Term will

                and any other Flagright Confidential Information in Customer’s
                possession, custody, or control. If Flagright terminates this
                Agreement for cause as provided in Section 6.4 (Termination for
                Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Term will
                become due and must be paid immediately by Customer. If Customer
                terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 6.4
                (Termination for Cause), Customer will receive a refund of any
                fees it has pre-paid for the terminated portion of the

                termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of

                Code, the Flagright Service is offered as an online, hosted

                has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any
